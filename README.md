# steve-i
*"A better steve" - me*

Steve is written in Rust using [Serenity](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity) and [Songbird](https://github.com/serenity-rs/songbird).  It was aimed to replace the dying music bot space for friends and no one else.

Currently this implements a search system from [rspotify](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify) to search for songs or playlists from Spotify, but it doesn't play music from Spotify.
